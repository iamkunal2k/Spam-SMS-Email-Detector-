# SMS/Email Spam Classifier

Welcome to the SMS/Email Spam Classifier! This project uses machine learning to identify whether a given message is spam or not. The notebook (sms-spam-detector.ipynb) consists steps to process and explore the dataset, convert messages to vectors and applying ML techniques for the same. It leverages Streamlit for the user interface, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Python for programming, and NLTK for natural language processing. This application provides a simple and intuitive way to classify messages.

## Features

- **User Interface:** Clean and interactive UI built with Streamlit.
- **Input Field:** Paste your message for analysis.
- **Prediction Button:** Classify the message as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' with a single click.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/iamkunal2k/Spam-SMS-Email-Detector-.git
   Spam-SMS-Email-Detector-
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate.ps1`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the Streamlit application with:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your web browser with the user interface of the spam classifier.

## Usage

1. **Paste Your Message:** Enter the SMS or email message you want to classify into the input field.
2. **Click 'Predict':** Press the "Predict" button to classify the message.
3. **View Results:** The application will display whether the message is categorized as 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application script providing the user interface.
- `model.pkl`: Pre-trained model used for predicting spam.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: Pre-trained vectorizer used for transforming text data.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
- `data/`: (Optional) Directory for storing any additional data files if needed.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **NLTK**
